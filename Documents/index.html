<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to explore and manipulate sound in the frequency domain. To do so, a genetic algorithm is used as a gateway to a <i>path</i> or <i>space</i> between two sounds. 
</p><p>
The goal is not to simply devise a method of rendering the target sound, as this can be done without a genetic algorithm. Instead, the goal is to allow for the exploration of the <i>path</i> that is generated by the algorithm. A wide range of unexplored sounds can be found between two different sounds, and this project attempts to explore that space through the use of the random mutations and alterations provided by a genetic algorithm.

  </ul>
  <li>A <a href="ugly_tone_to_french_horn.wav">convergence</a> from a very pure sine-tone to a french horn (esque) tone.
  <li>A <a href="otherTestC.wav">convergence</a> from a series of very low tones to a higher sine tone.
  <li>An sound that exists somewhere <a href="lost_generation.wav">in-between</a> the horn sound and the guitar sound.
